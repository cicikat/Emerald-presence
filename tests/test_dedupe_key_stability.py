tests/test_dedupe_key_stability.py — P1.1 dedupe_key stability audit

Verifies:
1. desktop_wake dedupe_key is stable: same wake stimulus → DUPLICATE even if result.event_id differs
2. scheduler dedupe_key is stable: same trigger identity within TTL → DUPLICATE
3. Different payload / different trigger → NOT duplicate (no false kill)
4. Different uid → NOT duplicate
5. Different char_id → NOT duplicate
6. result.event_id appears in dedup registry (tracing) but does NOT determine dedupe outcome
7. desktop_wake body with last_seen does NOT leak into dedup (fixed: payload={} in handler)
8. desktop_wake end-to-end: two rapid calls with differing last_seen → second is duplicate_wake
