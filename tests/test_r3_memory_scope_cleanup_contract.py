tests/test_r3_memory_scope_cleanup_contract.py
==============================================
R3 cleanup contract: verifies that allowlisted migration-target files still
have violations and tracks cleanup progress.

This test complements test_r3_scope_lint.py (which gates NEW violations) by
verifying that EXISTING allowlist entries still have violations — i.e., when a
file is cleaned up, this test fails, signalling the developer to remove that
entry from the allowlist in test_r3_scope_lint.py.

  test_r3_scope_lint.py              — gates NEW violations (fails when new bad code
                                       is added outside allowlists)
  test_r3_memory_scope_cleanup_contract.py — gates STALE ALLOWLIST ENTRIES (fails when
                                             an existing violation is fixed but the
                                             allowlist entry is not removed)

Together they keep both allowlists self-maintaining.

Allowlist categories:
  _FOREVER  — files where the default is correct by design; will never be cleaned.
  _MIGRATION_TARGETS — files with known violations scheduled for future cleanup.
