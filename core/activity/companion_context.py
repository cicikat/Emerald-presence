Activity companion context loaders (Brief 43 §C).

Read-only boundary change: activity companion chat (chess/gomoku) may now
*read* a short persona summary and the last few main-chat rounds to ground
its replies. The write boundary is unchanged — activity chat still never
writes short_term / event_log / user_hidden_state / afterglow.

All loaders fail-open: any read error returns "" so a memory hiccup never
breaks companion chat.
