================================
Phase 0 schema stub — User Hidden State System

=== FIELD ADMISSION TEST ===

  A field belongs in User Hidden State only if it describes the USER'S OWN
  psycho-physical constitution — something that remains meaningful regardless
  of which companion object is involved.

  Ask: "If the companion object changes, does this value reset to zero?"
    YES → it is relationship state. Do NOT put it here.
    NO  → it may belong here.

  Admitted:
    embodied_ease     — user's baseline ease/tension in body-intimate contexts.
                        A constitution-level set-point; regresses to center, not 0.

  Rejected (belong in a future relationship_state module):
    body_familiarity       — resets when the companion changes → relationship state.
    somatic_familiarity    — same reason → relationship state.

=== SECURITY BOUNDARIES (MUST READ BEFORE EXTENDING) ===

  Phase 0 scope:
    - Data structures, constants, function signatures, docstrings only.
    - No pipeline wiring.
    - No disk I/O.
    - No Dream writeback of any kind.
    - No WriteEnvelope stamp emitted here.
    - No direct memory / mood / profile / event_log writes.

  Write permissions:
    - DREAM_DIRECT_WRITABLE   = frozenset()   # Dream cannot directly mutate any field.
    - DIRECT_MEMORY_WRITABLE  = frozenset()   # This module does not write memory.
    - DIRECT_MOOD_WRITABLE    = frozenset()   # This module does not write mood.
    - DIRECT_PROFILE_WRITABLE = frozenset()   # This module does not write profile.
    - DIRECT_EVENT_LOG_WRITABLE = frozenset() # This module does not write event_log.

  Future persistence path:
    - All persistent writes must flow through the Reality-side integrator,
      which must obtain a WriteEnvelope with can_write_memory=True before
      calling any mutating function defined here.
    - Dream-derived update sources (DREAM_AFTERGLOW, DREAM_IMPRESSION,
      DREAM_BODY_EVENT) may only enter via the Reality-side integrator at
      Dream exit — never from within a live Dream turn.

  Sensor / Watch:
    - SENSOR_SIGNAL is defined as an UpdateSource for future extensibility.
    - In Phase 0 and until an explicit WriteEnvelope with can_write_memory=True
      is granted, sensor/watch raw signals must NOT affect long-term state.
    - Do not assume heart-rate, screen text, or activity data auto-enters
      persistent state.

  Render tags:
    - <say> / <thought> / <narration> are desktop render structures.
    - This module must not use render tags as evidence for hidden-state updates.
    - Only stripped plain-text or structured events should be used.

  QQ channel isolation:
    - DREAM_ACTIVE / DREAM_CLOSING: QQ owner messages are rejected upstream.
    - No logic in this module may depend on "QQ补消息 during Dream."

  data/chars retirement:
    - This module must not reference data/chars/{char_id}.
    - Future path access must use user_memory_root(...) — not wired in Phase 0.
